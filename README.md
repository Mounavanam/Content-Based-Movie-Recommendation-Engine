# Content-Based Movie Recommendation Engine
implemented a system to analyze and predict user preferences based on movie metadata. Applied cosine similarity measures to compute similarity scores between movies, enhancing the personalized user experience. 

### Python Libraries Used
- pandas
- numpy
- sklearn.feature_extraction.text : for text vectorization
- sklearn.metrics.pairwise library : to accurately gauge content similarities


Further, the project can be extended by combining content-based filtering with collaborative filtering to leverage both the content of the movies and the preferences of a community of users.
